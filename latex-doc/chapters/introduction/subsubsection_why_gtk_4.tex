\subsubsection{Why GTK 4}

\gls{gtk} is cross-platform and looks modern. Compare to \gls{wxwidgets}, which was used originally for this project, that uses native API for each supported platform, \gls{gtk} is consistent in how it looks, also it supports 3D rendering more effectively.

I recommend wxWidgets for cross-platform C++ as it is easy to use but for this project I decided to experiment bit more and as mentioned, GTK 4 has more direct control over 3D rendering which I’m planning to use if not in this project then surely in the next one.
